# Data-driven ynamic mode decomposition
This git repository contains the Jupyter notebook and code presented at the "Data-driven dynamic mode decomposition" workshop. For slides please see the "[Group Activities](https://courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am205/g_act/index.html#multithreading)" tab on the main website.

The workshop contains two exercises for learning the dynamic mode decomposition in ```dmd_assignment.ipynb```:
- Ex 1: (in-workshop) discuss examples of dynamical systems and write a DMD function
- Ex 2: (homework) apply DMD on a "flow past a cylinder" example
