# ENO schemes for simulating traffic and reference map advection
This git repository contains Python demos and jupyter notebook exercises featured during the activity.

- ```discont_inter.py``` - Example demonstrating Gibbs phenomenon when constructing a polynomial interpolant of an approximately discontinuous function.
- ```lin_adv.py``` - Linear advection example with initial sigmoid step function that develops oscillations using a 2nd order upwind scheme.
- ```lin_adv_eno.ipynb``` - An exercise on solving the above linear advection example using the ENO scheme.
- ```lin_adv_eno_solutions.ipynb``` - Solutions to the above exercise.
