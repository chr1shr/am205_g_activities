        "# The DAE solver class\n",
        "The code below provides a skeleton for a DAE solver class. When completed, the user should be able to call the method ```integrate```, which integrates the supplied function ```fun``` with jacobian ```jac``` over a specified time range and step size. The solver calls a pseudo-private, internal method ```newton```, which solves a root-finding problem at each integration step. Following the notes from the session, implement the routine for Newton's method to complete the solver."
