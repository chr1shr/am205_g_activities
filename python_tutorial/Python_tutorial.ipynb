However, you'll see code examples throughout the course primarily as ```.py``` scripts executed via terminal, which is typically our preferred environment for easily and efficiently running programs. However, for this demo and if you choose to use notebooks later on, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind:\n",

If you want to delete or rename a variable, make sure you update its occurrences throughout the notebook. You can restart your runtime and run all cells to check for any undefined variables."
